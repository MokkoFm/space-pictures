# Space Instagram

The program helps you to get pictures of space from API of Hubble and SpaceX and download it to Instagram automatically. 

### How to install

You can put your login and password from Instagram here: 
```
insta_login = os.getenv("LOGIN")
insta_password = os.getenv("PASSWORD")
```

If you want to do it with safety, you can use .env file. 

Python3 should be already installed. 
Then use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org/).
